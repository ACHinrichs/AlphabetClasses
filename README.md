# AlphabetClasses


This repository features most of my custom LaTex classes in use for all sorts
of documents during my studys in computer science at RWTH Aachen.

Currently features
*   ctext, a top-notch text class based on article
*   atext, ctext's predeccessor and a more basic approach to article's default look
*   btext, a seperate text class based on KOMA's scrartcl
*   dtext, a more fictional text oriented article child
*   amath, a math package using ams, defining all sorts of mathematical shorthand commands
*   bmath, another math package defining environments corresponding to (a,b,c)text's (even dtext, but not supported on purpose) design style
*   atask, a package introducing new sectioning options for homework
*   acode, a small package, simply defining styles for listings

## Installation

Just clone this repository into your user directory for TeX and use classes and packages as intended.

## Documentation

Most classes and packages are quite intuitive. ~~ctext got a complete documentation (see /ctext/ctext.pdf), all other classes and packages have extensive examples (see /examples/), which will usually explain all commands and options.~~
